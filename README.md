# atomic-fns

[Read the Docs](https://atomic-fns.dev)

## Like Lodash, but in TypeScript and for ESNext.

Stop shipping code built for browsers from 2015. Really though, look at all the [issues](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/2930).

You may prefer this because it's:

* **TypeScript & docs**: Includes type declaration files and js with JSDocs for best in class experience.
* **Zero deps**: Built from scratch with no runtime dependencies or polyfills.
* **ESNext**: Uses modern idiomatic syntax, data structures, and control flow techniques.
* **Modular**: Pick what you need. Supports tree-shaking, no side effects, and works with all bundlers.
* **Lazy**: Leverage generators, iterators, and functional composition.
* **Tests**: All modules have comprehensive test suites and public apis are 100% covered.

## Get Started

This library is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atomic-fns).

To install the package you need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)) installed and then run:

```bash
npm install atomic-fns
```

## How to use

Just import any function or class you need.

```js
import { sorted, times, uniqueId } from 'atomic-fns'

times(5, (i) => i)
// -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

sorted([4, 3, 2, 1])
// -> [1, 2, 3, 4]

uniqueId('user_')
// -> 'user_101225005'
...
```

## Data model
This library features a data model similar to [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) but not always. Only the missing parts have been implemented, while respecting the JS standards.

For example, in Python collections, `size()` is a method, while in JS it's just a property. So this library uses `size` property instead of method. Similarly, the `len` function implementation checks for both `length` and `size` since many JS objects have a `length` property.

## Special method names
This library adds support for operators using object methods such as:
  - `obj.eq(other)`  adds custom `obj == other`.
  - `obj.lt(other)`  adds custom `obj < other`.
  - `obj.lte(other)`  adds custom `obj <= other`.
  - `obj.gt(other)`  adds custom `obj > other`.
  - `obj.gte(other)`  adds custom `obj >= other`.
  - `obj.compare(other)`  overloads sorting operations.

When working with objects, functions in this library use these custom operators for equality and sorting. You can also apply operators to values like `eq(x, y)`, `lte(x, y)`, `compare(x, y)`, etc.

## New Types

[`Decimal`](https://atomic-fns.dev/classes/decimal.Decimal.html) provides support for correct rounded floating point arithmetic, with arbitrary precision.

Some common base interfaces and typing patterns you may have seen like `Optional`, `Result`, `Comparable`, `Iterator`, and others.
