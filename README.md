# atomic-fns

## Like Lodash, but for ESNext and with types.

Stop shipping code built for browsers from 2015. Really though, look at the [issues](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/2930).

You may prefer this because it's:

* **Modular**: Pick what you need. Works with all bundlers and also supports tree-shaking.
* **ESNext**: Uses modern idiomatic syntax, data structures, and control flow techniques.
* **Lazy**: Leverage generators, iterators, and functional composition.
* **Zero deps**: Built from scratch with no dependencies whatsoever.
* **Well tested**: All modules have comprehensive test suites aiming for 100% coverage.
* **TypeScript & docs**: Includes type declaration files and js with JSDocs for best in class experience.

## Get Started

This library is available as an npm package. To install the package just run:

```bash
npm install atomic-fns
```

## How to use
```typescript
import { reversed, sorted, times, uniqueId } from 'atomic-fns'

reversed([1, 2, 3, 4])
// -> [4, 3, 2, 1]

sorted([4, 3, 2, 1])
// -> [1, 2, 3, 4]

times(5, (i) => i)
// -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

uniqueId('user_')
// -> 'user_101225005'
```
